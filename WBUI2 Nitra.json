The typical method of opening the shop is to use the assigned button shown on the buff icon (F1-F5). When on controller the way to open the shop is through the multi-use menu. To open the multi-use menu use the left face button (Either X for Xbox or Square for Playstation (You can also do this on Mouse and Key with holding R)) and navigate to the shop icon in the menu. Make sure to select the option in the menu with either A/X or RT and if a second menu opens to select the Gold Bag icon you must press A/X or RT on that as well, do not let go of the left face button while in the menu or when you have hovered the icon assuming it will open the shop, you must press A/X or RT specifically to select the shop in order for it to open properly.\r\n",
